This game, dubbed \"TigerZone\" is a spinoff of the popular board game \"Carcassonne\". TigerZone reflects adaptations to Carassonne by including new features such as new scoring features. The full game description and rules can be found on our client's website [here](http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~dts/cen3031/TigerZone%20v2.2.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project was to utilize agile software development skills that were discussed throughout the course. Our team utilized sprints to get specific features working and to build our overall project progress in incremental ways that helped with testing. As explained above, the goal of this project was to create an AI that could play against other teams in the class by connecting to a TCP server. A game was won by scoring points strategically by completing game features.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Sprint Outline\r\nClick each of the sprints below to view the documentation that includes sprint summary and work accomplished by each team member.\r\n\r\n\r\n* ### [Sprint 1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1yJp_1wTi1bSWQ0eVh5SE5pUFU) \r\nTimeline: 10/31/16 - 11/7/16\r\n\r\n\r\n* ### [Sprint 2]() \r\nTimeline: 11/8/16 - 11/14/16\r\n\r\n\r\n* ### [Sprint 3]() \r\nTimeline: 11/15/16 - 11/21/16\r\n\r\n\r\n* ### [Sprint 4]() \r\nTimeline: 11/22/16 - 12/2/16\r\n\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n* ### UML Diagram\r\n\r\n* ### Hexagonal Architecture\r\n\r\n* ### Story Tracking\r\n\r\n* ### Tile Logic\r\nmaybe include a scanned picture showing how we made our tiles (edges, corners, ect)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nideas: GUI, connecting to server\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building TigerZone\r\nThe below instructions are included to help users run our program.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TigerClient\r\n\r\n\r\n### Running the Client\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\na detailed list of all the known bugs/issues needing to be addressed\r\n\r\n## Development Summary\r\ndiscuss what you learnt while doing this project, what you took away, ect.\r\n\r\n* ### Adam Schuster\r\n\r\n* ### Adam Wexler\r\n\r\n* ### Brandon Goldman\r\n\r\n* ### Bradley Lazar\r\n\r\n* ### Alexander Krepacki\r\n\r\n* ### David Weng\r\n",
